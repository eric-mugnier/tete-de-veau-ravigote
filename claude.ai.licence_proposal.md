Since this is your friend Éric Mugnier's work, the licensing question is actually quite delicate — and the most important point comes first:

**The copyright belongs to Éric, not to you.** Even if you're the one managing the repo, you can't choose a license on his behalf without his explicit agreement. So the first step is to discuss this with him.

That said, here are the realistic options depending on what he wants:

**If Éric wants to keep full control (most likely for an unpublished novel):**
- **No license / All Rights Reserved** — this is actually the *default* when you publish something publicly with no license attached. Anyone can read it but cannot reproduce, modify or redistribute it. This is probably the safest option for an unpublished literary work.
- **CC BY-ND** (Creative Commons Attribution - No Derivatives) — allows sharing with attribution, but prohibits modifications. Protects the integrity of the text.

**If Éric is open to sharing:**
- **CC BY-NC-ND** — share freely, with attribution, non-commercial, no derivatives. Often used by authors who want visibility without losing control.
- **CC BY** — very permissive, allows even commercial reuse. Unusual for fiction.

**My practical recommendation:**

For a novel, especially unpublished, I'd suggest one of two approaches:
1. **No license + a clear README** stating "© Éric Mugnier, all rights reserved — this repository is for version tracking purposes only"
2. **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** if Éric wants people to be able to read and share it freely

The key question to ask Éric: does he intend to submit this to publishers? If so, **All Rights Reserved** is safer — some publishers are wary of works already publicly licensed.
